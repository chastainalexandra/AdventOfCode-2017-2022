 calendars             Show the calendars

2) To start working on new problems:
login to https://adventofcode.com, then copy your session cookie, and export 
it in your console like this

 export SESSION=73a37e9a72a...

then run the app with

 update [year]/[day]   Prepares a folder for the given day, updates the input,
                       the readme and creates a solution template.
 update today          Shortcut to the above.

3) To upload your answer:
set up your SESSION variable as above.

 upload [year]/[day]   Upload the answer for the selected year and day.
 upload today          Shortcut to the above.


Working in Visual Studio Code
If you prefer, you can work directly in VSCode as well.

Open the command Palette (⇧ ⌘ P), select Tasks: Run Task then e.g. update today.

Work on part 1. Check the solution with the upload today task. Continue with part 2.

Note: this feature relies on the "Memento Inputs" extension to store your session cookie, you need to set it up in advance from the Command Palette with Install Extensions.
